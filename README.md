# 3x3_Rubik_Cube_Blindfold_Practice

This repository contains a Python script designed to help speedcubers memorize edge pairings for the Old Pochmann method of solving a 3x3 Rubik's Cube blindfolded. The program randomly selects edge color pairs and prompts the user to input their corresponding letter pair notation, assisting in learning and practicing the mapping of colors to letters.

Features

Interactive Quiz: The program presents random edge pieces and asks for their corresponding letter pair names.

Customizable Dictionary: The edge color pairings and their letter mappings are defined in a dictionary. You can easily modify it to add your own preferences or extend it to include other pieces.

Score Tracking: Tracks and displays your score to keep you motivated as you practice.

Exit Anytime: Type exit to quit the program.

How It Works

The program contains a dictionary mapping color pairs (e.g., ('WHITE', 'BLUE')) to letter pairs (e.g., 'AQ').

A random color pair is selected, and the user is prompted to provide the corresponding letter pair.

The program checks the input:

If correct, the score increases.

If incorrect, the correct letter pair is displayed.

The quiz continues until the user types exit.
